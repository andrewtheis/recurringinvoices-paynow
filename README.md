# recurringinvoices-paynow
A retrofit for the popular open source invoice software Bamboo Invoice that adds a recurring invoice feature. 

When the set recurring interval is reached a duplicate invoice is created. With the PayNow feature you can enter in your Google Merchant ID or PayPal e-mail into the Bamboo Invoice settings page to allow your customers to pay you via these services (a button will be added the PDFs generated).
